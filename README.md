## Hi there 👋

**Vanderlad/Vanderlad** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hi, my name is Vlad and I am a student at the University of Windsor studying computer science. I plan to use github to keep all of my files for my projects accessible since I tend to move around a lot between my home pc, laptop and school computers.

Excited to practice and learn using github!
