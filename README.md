## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vlad and I am a student at the University of Windsor studying computer science. I plan to use github to keep all of my files for my projects accessible since I tend to move around a lot between my home pc, laptop and school computers.

Excited to practice and learn using github!
